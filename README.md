# Portfolio Website!
Mock-Up of a Personal portfolio website using css and vanilla JavaScript. Contains links to created projects and a self-description ('About Me') section.

## Description
As stated above this website was made using only **CSS** and **vanilla JavaScript** (with the additional use of Font Awesome fonts). The goal was to design a basic website that contains different sections describing the owner and listing projects and programs that have been created by said owner. Most of the functionality comes from the CSS files in the project. However, JavaScript is used to add a *color theme changer*, a *drop down menu*, and a *hidden form button*. The design of the page mainly uses **CSS Grid** with some use of **Flexbox** for certain elements such as the navbar and the side-bar.

## Skills/Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. HTML Forms
3. CSS
4. CSS Grid
5. FlexBox
6. Vanilla JavaScript
7. Full Website Responsiveness

## Development Plans:
 The plans for this website are mainly to update the UI/UX elements to make for a more pleasant navigating and viewing experience. This will be accomplished via the use of JavaScript libraries that allow for easier intergration of certain effects such as text/element animation and full-page scrolling.
